                <h3>Fiddle</h3>
                <p>
                    The Irish fiddle is one of the most important instruments in the traditional repertoire of Irish
                    music.
                    The fiddle itself is identical to the violin, however it is played differently in widely varying
                    regional styles. In the era of sound recording some regional styles have been transmitted more
                    widely
                    while others have become more uncommon. Compared to classical violin, Irish fiddler tend to make
                    little
                    use of vibrato except for slow airs, and even then it is used relatively sparingly. Like the rest of
                    Irish traditional music tradition, melodies are embellished through forms of ornamentation, such as
                    rolls, trebles, and cuts. Irish fiddlers also use a vocabulary of bow slurs different from other
                    fiddle
                    traditions, at least in proportion of usage. Most notably, fiddlers often slur into the beat to
                    produce
                    a certain lilt, not unlike the Newcastle hornpipe style of bowing in England and Scotland, though
                    the
                    technique in Ireland is not restricted to hornpipes. They may also slur over beats in such a pattern
                    as
                    to create a natural back-beat in reels. Numerous Irish Reels are performed by The Dubliners, one of
                    the
                    pioneers of traditional Irish Music. Slow airs are occasionally played upon the fiddle, but the
                    style is
                    best known for fast, snappy reels and jigs. Strathspeys, popular in Scottish Fiddle are seldom
                    played,
                    as such, but there are some tunes which amply utilized dotted rhythm.

                <h3>Uilleann Pipes</h3>
                <p>
                    The uilleann pipes are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland. Earlier known in English as
                    “union pipes”, their current name is a partial translation of the Irish-language term píobaí
                    uilleann (literally, “pipes of the elbow”), from their method of inflation. There is no historical
                    record of the name or use of the term uilleann pipes before the twentieth century. It was an
                    invention of Grattan Flood and the name stuck. People mistook the term ‘union’ to refer to the 1800
                    Act of Union; this is incorrect as Breandán Breathnach points out that a poem published in 1796 uses
                    the term ‘union’. The bag of the uilleann pipes is inflated by means of a small set of bellows
                    strapped around the waist and the right arm (in the case of a right-handed player; in the case of a
                    left-handed player the location and orientation of all components are reversed). The bellows not
                    only relieve the player from the effort needed to blow into a bag to maintain pressure, they also
                    allow relatively dry air to power the reeds, reducing the adverse effects of moisture on tuning and
                    longevity. Some pipers can converse or sing while playing. The uilleann pipes have a different
                    harmonic structure, sounding sweeter and quieter than many other bagpipes, such as the Great Irish
                    warpipes, Great Highland bagpipes or the Italian zampognas. The uilleann pipes are often played
                    indoors, and are almost always played sitting down.

                <h3>Bodhran</h3>
                <p>
                    The bodhrán is a frame drum of Irish origin ranging from 25 to 65 cm in diameter, with most drums
                    measuring 35–45 cm . The sides of the drum are 9–20 cm deep. A goatskin head is tacked to one side
                    (synthetic heads or other animal skins are sometimes used). The other side is open-ended for one
                    hand to be placed against the inside of the drum head to control the pitch and timbre. One or two
                    crossbars, sometimes removable, may be inside the frame, but this is increasingly rare on modern
                    instruments. Some professional modern bodhráns integrate mechanical tuning systems similar to those
                    used on drums found in drum kits. It is usually with a hex key that the bodhrán skins are tightened
                    or loosened depending on the atmospheric conditions. The Irish word bodhrán is first mentioned in a
                    translated English document in the 17th century. It appears in Jacob Pool’s list of words from the
                    Baronies of Forth and Bargy in county Wexford, meaning “A drum, tambourine…also a sieve used in
                    winnowing corn”. Third-generation bodhrán maker Caramel Tobin suggests that the name bodhrán means
                    “skin tray”. He also suggests a link with the Irish word bodhar, meaning, among other things, a drum
                    or a dull sound. A relatively new introduction to Irish music, the bodhrán has largely replaced the
                    role of the tambourine.
