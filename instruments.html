                <h3>Fiddle</h3>
                <p>
                    The Irish fiddle is one of the most important instruments in the traditional repertoire of Irish
                    music.
                    The fiddle itself is identical to the violin, however it is played differently in widely varying
                    regional styles. In the era of sound recording some regional styles have been transmitted more
                    widely
                    while others have become more uncommon. Compared to classical violin, Irish fiddler tend to make
                    little
                    use of vibrato except for slow airs, and even then it is used relatively sparingly. Like the rest of
                    Irish traditional music tradition, melodies are embellished through forms of ornamentation, such as
                    rolls, trebles, and cuts. Irish fiddlers also use a vocabulary of bow slurs different from other
                    fiddle
                    traditions, at least in proportion of usage. Most notably, fiddlers often slur into the beat to
                    produce
                    a certain lilt, not unlike the Newcastle hornpipe style of bowing in England and Scotland, though
                    the
                    technique in Ireland is not restricted to hornpipes. They may also slur over beats in such a pattern
                    as
                    to create a natural back-beat in reels. Numerous Irish Reels are performed by The Dubliners, one of
                    the
                    pioneers of traditional Irish Music. Slow airs are occasionally played upon the fiddle, but the
                    style is
                    best known for fast, snappy reels and jigs. Strathspeys, popular in Scottish Fiddle are seldom
                    played,
                    as such, but there are some tunes which amply utilized dotted rhythm.

                <h3>Uilleann Pipes</h3>
                <p>
                    The uilleann pipes are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland. Earlier known in English as
                    “union pipes”, their current name is a partial translation of the Irish-language term píobaí
                    uilleann (literally, “pipes of the elbow”), from their method of inflation. There is no historical
                    record of the name or use of the term uilleann pipes before the twentieth century. It was an
                    invention of Grattan Flood and the name stuck. People mistook the term ‘union’ to refer to the 1800
                    Act of Union; this is incorrect as Breandán Breathnach points out that a poem published in 1796 uses
                    the term ‘union’. The bag of the uilleann pipes is inflated by means of a small set of bellows
                    strapped around the waist and the right arm (in the case of a right-handed player; in the case of a
                    left-handed player the location and orientation of all components are reversed). The bellows not
                    only relieve the player from the effort needed to blow into a bag to maintain pressure, they also
                    allow relatively dry air to power the reeds, reducing the adverse effects of moisture on tuning and
                    longevity. Some pipers can converse or sing while playing. The uilleann pipes have a different
                    harmonic structure, sounding sweeter and quieter than many other bagpipes, such as the Great Irish
                    warpipes, Great Highland bagpipes or the Italian zampognas. The uilleann pipes are often played
                    indoors, and are almost always played sitting down.

                <h3>Bodhran</h3>
                <p>
                    The bodhrán is a frame drum of Irish origin ranging from 25 to 65 cm in diameter, with most drums
                    measuring 35–45 cm . The sides of the drum are 9–20 cm deep. A goatskin head is tacked to one side
                    (synthetic heads or other animal skins are sometimes used). The other side is open-ended for one
                    hand to be placed against the inside of the drum head to control the pitch and timbre. One or two
                    crossbars, sometimes removable, may be inside the frame, but this is increasingly rare on modern
                    instruments. Some professional modern bodhráns integrate mechanical tuning systems similar to those
                    used on drums found in drum kits. It is usually with a hex key that the bodhrán skins are tightened
                    or loosened depending on the atmospheric conditions. The Irish word bodhrán is first mentioned in a
                    translated English document in the 17th century. It appears in Jacob Pool’s list of words from the
                    Baronies of Forth and Bargy in county Wexford, meaning “A drum, tambourine…also a sieve used in
                    winnowing corn”. Third-generation bodhrán maker Caramel Tobin suggests that the name bodhrán means
                    “skin tray”. He also suggests a link with the Irish word bodhar, meaning, among other things, a drum
                    or a dull sound. A relatively new introduction to Irish music, the bodhrán has largely replaced the
                    role of the tambourine.

                    The Irish fiddle is one of the most important instruments in the traditional repertoire of Irish
                    music. The fiddle itself is identical to the violin, however it is played differently in widely
                    varying regional styles. In the era of sound recording some regional styles have been transmitted
                    more widely while others have become more uncommon.Contemporary performers Modern performers
                    include: Liz Carroll (All-Ireland Junior and Senior Fiddle Champion); John Carty; Brian Conway; Matt
                    Cranitch; Desi Donnelly; Martin Fay; Frankie Gavin; Cathal Hayden; Kevin Burke; Martin Hayes; Eileen

                    Michael Coleman did much to popularise Irish music in the United States in the 1920s. More recently
                    Michael Gorman was also a huge influence. Donegal fiddler John Doherty came from a large family of
                    fiddlers. He travelled all over Ireland, developing an encyclopedic knowledge of fiddle tunes. He
                    was one of the last of the travelling fiddlers. He had a large body of knowledge of Scottish
                    (especially marches and highlands) music as well. The fiddle has ancient roots in Ireland, the first
                    report of bowed instruments similar to the violin being in the Book of Leinster (ca. 1160). The
                    modern violin was ubiquitous in Ireland by the early 1700s. Compared to classical violin, Irish
                    fiddler tend to make little use of vibrato except for slow airs, and even then it is used relatively
                    sparingly. Like the rest of Irish traditional music tradition, melodies are embellished through
                    forms of ornamentation, such as rolls, trebles, and cuts. Irish fiddlers also use a vocabulary of
                    bow slurs different from other fiddle traditions, at least in proportion of usage. Most notably,
                    fiddlers often slur into the beat to produce a certain lilt, not unlike the Newcastle hornpipe style
                    of bowing in England and Scotland, though the technique in Ireland is not restricted to hornpipes.
                    They may also slur over beats in such a pattern as to create a natural back-beat in reels. Numerous
                    Irish Reels are performed by The Dubliners, one of the pioneers of traditional Irish Music. Slow
                    airs are occasionally played upon the fiddle, but the style is best known for fast, snappy reels and
                    jigs. Strathspeys, popular in Scottish Fiddle are seldom played, as such, but there are some tunes
                    which amply utilized dotted rhythm. Some tunes are: In Irish fiddling there are few known composers,
                    as many tunes have been taught by ear and passed down from one generation to another. Also, many
                    players adjusted tunes to suit their style and taste, so there can be many variations for a
                    particular tune.

                    The uilleann pipes are the characteristic national bagpipe of Ireland. Earlier known in English as
                    “union pipes”, their current name is a partial translation of the Irish-language term píobaí
                    uilleann (literally, “pipes of the elbow”), from their method of inflation. There is no historical
                    record of the name or use of the term uilleann pipes before the twentieth century. It was an
                    invention of Grattan Flood and the name stuck. People mistook the term ‘union’ to refer to the 1800
                    Act of Union; this is incorrect as Breandán Breathnach points out that a poem published in 1796 uses
                    the term ‘union’. The bag of the uilleann pipes is inflated by means of a small set of bellows
                    strapped around the waist and the right arm (in the case of a right-handed player; in the case of a
                    left-handed player the location and orientation of all components are reversed). The bellows not
                    only relieve the player from the effort needed to blow into a bag to maintain pressure, they also
                    allow relatively dry air to power the reeds, reducing the adverse effects of moisture on tuning and
                    longevity. Some pipers can converse or sing while playing. The uilleann pipes are distinguished from
                    many other forms of bagpipes by their tone and wide range of notes – the chanter has a range of two
                    full octaves, including sharps and flats – together with the unique blend of chanter, drones, and
                    regulators. The regulators are equipped with closed keys that can be opened by the piper’s wrist
                    action enabling the piper to play simple chords, giving a rhythmic and harmonic accompaniment as
                    needed. There are also many ornaments based on multiple or single grace notes. The chanter can also
                    be played staccato by resting the bottom of the chanter on the piper’s thigh to close off the bottom
                    hole and then open and close only the tone holes required. If one tone hole is closed before the
                    next one is opened, a staccato effect can be created because the sound stops completely when no air
                    can escape at all. The uilleann pipes have a different harmonic structure, sounding sweeter and
                    quieter than many other bagpipes, such as the Great Irish warpipes, Great Highland bagpipes or the
                    Italian zampognas. The uilleann pipes are often played indoors, and are almost always played sitting
                    down. Uilleann is the genitive of the Irish word uillinn, meaning "elbow", emphasising the use of
                    the elbow when playing the uilleann pipes. The Irish word for uilleann pipes is píobaí uilleann,
                    which means "pipes of the elbow". However, the first attested written form is "Union pipes", at the
                    end of the 18th century, perhaps to denote the union of the chanter, drones, and regulators. Another
                    theory is that it was played throughout a prototypical full union of England, Wales, Ireland and
                    Scotland. This is definitely untrue, because this name for the instrument predates the Act of Union,
                    which took effect in 1801. Alternatively, the uilleann pipes were certainly a favorite of the upper
                    classes in Scotland, Ireland and the North-East of England and were fashionable for a time in formal
                    social settings, where the term Union pipes may also originate.

                    The bodhrán, is a frame drum of Irish origin ranging from 25 to 65 cm (10–26 in) in diameter, with
                    most drums measuring 35–45 cm (14–18 in). The sides of the drum are 9–20 cm (3 1⁄2–8 in) deep. A
                    goatskin head is tacked to one side (synthetic heads or other animal skins are sometimes used). The
                    other side is open-ended for one hand to be placed against the inside of the drum head to control
                    the pitch and timbre. One or two crossbars, sometimes removable, may be inside the frame, but this
                    is increasingly rare on modern instruments. Some professional modern bodhráns integrate mechanical
                    tuning systems similar to those used on drums found in drum kits. It is usually with a hex key that
                    the bodhrán skins are tightened or loosened depending on the atmospheric conditions. According to
                    musician Ronan Nolan, former editor of Irish Music magazine, the bodhrán evolved in the mid-19th
                    century from the tambourine, which can be heard on some Irish music recordings dating back to the
                    1920s and viewed in a pre-Famine painting. However, in remote parts of the south-west, the “poor
                    man’s tambourine” – made from farm implements and without the cymbals – was in popular use among
                    mummers, or wren boys. A large oil painting on canvas by Daniel Maclise (1806–1870) depicts a large
                    Halloween house party in which a bodhrán features clearly. That painting, produced c. 1842, shows a
                    flautist accompanied by a tambourine player who, in an Arabic style in contrast to standard bodhrán
                    technique, used his fingers rather than a tipper. It is known that by the early 20th century,
                    home-made frame drums were constructed using willow branches as frames, leather as drumheads, and
                    pennies as jingles. In photographs from the 1940s and videos from the 1950s, jingles remained part
                    of the bodhrán construction like a tambourine, yet were played with cipín, also known in English as
                    “tipper”. Seán Ó Riada declared the bodhrán to be the native drum of the Celts as did Paraic McNeela
                    (The Bodhrán Maker) possibly used originally for winnowing or the dying of wool, with a musical
                    history that predated Christianity, native to southwest Ireland. The Irish word bodhrán is first
                    mentioned in a translated English document in the 17th century. It appears in Jacob Pool's list of
                    words from the Baronies of Forth and Bargy in county Wexford (collected in the late 18th century),
                    meaning "A drum, tambourine...also a sieve used in winnowing corn”. Third-generation bodhrán maker
                    Caramel Tobin suggests that the name bodhrán means "skin tray". He also suggests a link with the
                    Irish word bodhar, meaning, among other things, a drum or a dull sound (it also means deaf). A
                    relatively new introduction to Irish music, the bodhrán has largely replaced the role of the
                    tambourine.
