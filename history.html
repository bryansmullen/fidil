                    <h3>Introduction to Irish Music History Part 1</h3>
                    <p>
                        Irish traditional music (also known as Irish trad, Irish folk music, and other variants) is a
                        genre
                        of folk music that developed in Ireland. In A History of Irish Music (1905), W. H. Grattan Flood
                        wrote that, in Gaelic Ireland, there were at least ten instruments in general use. These were
                        the
                        cruit (a small harp) and clairseach (a bigger harp with typically 30 strings), the timpan (a
                        small
                        string instrument played with a bow or plectrum), the feadan (a fife), the buinne (an oboe or
                        flute), the guthbuinne (a bassoon-type horn), the bennbuabhal and corn (hornpipes), the
                        cuislenna
                        (bagpipes – see Great Irish warpipes), the stoc and sturgan (clarions or trumpets), and the
                        cnamha
                        (bones). There is also evidence of the fiddle being used in the 8th century. There are several
                        collections of Irish folk music from the 18th century, but it was not until the 19th century
                        that
                        ballad printers became established in Dublin. Important collectors include Colm Ó Lochlainn,
                        George
                        Petrie, Edward Bunting, Francis O’Neill, James Goodman and many others. Though solo performance
                        is
                        preferred in the folk tradition, bands or at least small ensembles have probably been a part of
                        Irish music since at least the mid-19th century, although this is a point of much contention
                        among
                        ethnomusicologists.

                    <h3>Introduction to Irish Music History Part 2</h3>
                    <p>
                        Irish dance music is isometric and is built around patterns of bar-long melodic phrases akin to
                        call and response. A common pattern is A Phrase, B Phrase, A Phrase, Partial Resolution, A
                        Phrase, B Phrase, A Phrase, Final Resolution, though this is not universal; mazurkas, for
                        example, tend to feature a C Phrase instead of a repeated A Phrase before the Partial and Final
                        Resolutions, for example. Many tunes have pickup notes which lead in to the beginning of the A
                        or B parts. Mazurkas and hornpipes have a swing feel, while other tunes have straight feels.
                        Tunes are typically binary in form, divided into two (or sometimes more) parts, each with four
                        to eight bars.

                        The parts are referred to as the A-part, B-part, and so on. Each part is played twice, and the
                        entire tune is played three times; AABB, AABB, AABB. Many tunes have similar ending phrases for
                        both A and B parts; it is common for hornpipes to have the second half of each part be
                        identical. Additionally, hornpipes often have three quavers or quarternotes at the end of each
                        part, followed by pickup notes to lead back to the beginning of the A part of onto the B part.
                        Many airs have an AABA form.

                    Irish traditional music (also known as Irish trad, Irish folk music, and other variants) is a genre
                    of folk music that developed in Ireland. In A History of Irish Music (1905), W. H. Grattan Flood
                    wrote that, in Gaelic Ireland, there were at least ten instruments in general use. These were the
                    cruit (a small harp) and clairseach (a bigger harp with typically 30 strings), the timpan (a small
                    string instrument played with a bow or plectrum), the feadan (a fife), the buinne (an oboe or
                    flute), the guthbuinne (a bassoon-type horn), the bennbuabhal and corn (hornpipes), the cuislenna
                    (bagpipes – see Great Irish warpipes), the stoc and sturgan (clarions or trumpets), and the cnamha
                    (bones). There is also evidence of the fiddle being used in the 8th century. There are several
                    collections of Irish folk music from the 18th century, but it was not until the 19th century that
                    ballad printers became established in Dublin. Important collectors include Colm Ó Lochlainn, George
                    Petrie, Edward Bunting, Francis O’Neill, James Goodman and many others. Though solo performance is
                    preferred in the folk tradition, bands or at least small ensembles have probably been a part of
                    Irish music since at least the mid-19th century, although this is a point of much contention among
                    ethnomusicologists. Irish traditional music has endured more strongly against the forces of cinema,
                    radio and the mass media than the indigenous folk music of most European countries. This was
                    possibly because the country was not a geographical battleground in either of the two World
                    Wars.[citation needed] Another potential factor was that the economy was largely agricultural, where
                    oral tradition usually thrives[citation needed]. From the end of the Second World War until the late
                    fifties folk music was held in low regard. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann (an Irish traditional music
                    association) and the popularity of the Fleadh Cheoil (music festival) helped lead the revival of the
                    music. The English Folk music scene also encouraged and gave self-confidence to many Irish
                    musicians[citation needed]. Following the success of The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem in the US
                    in 1959, Irish folk music became fashionable again. The lush sentimental style of singers such as
                    Delia Murphy was replaced by guitar-driven male groups such as The Dubliners. Irish showbands
                    presented a mixture of pop music and folk dance tunes, though these died out during the seventies.
                    The international success of The Chieftains and subsequent musicians and groups has made Irish folk
                    music a global brand. Historically much old-time music of the USA grew out of the music of Ireland,
                    England and Scotland, as a result of cultural diffusion. By the 1970s Irish traditional music was
                    again influencing music in the US and further afield in Australia and Europe. It has occasionally
                    been fused with rock and roll, punk rock and other genres.

                    Irish dance music is isometric and is built around patterns of bar-long melodic phrases akin to call
                    and response. A common pattern is A Phrase, B Phrase, A Phrase, Partial Resolution, A Phrase, B
                    Phrase, A Phrase, Final Resolution, though this is not universal; mazurkas, for example, tend to
                    feature a C Phrase instead of a repeated A Phrase before the Partial and Final Resolutions, for
                    example. Many tunes have pickup notes which lead in to the beginning of the A or B parts. Mazurkas
                    and hornpipes have a swing feel, while other tunes have straight feels. Tunes are typically binary
                    in form, divided into two (or sometimes more) parts, each with four to eight bars. The parts are
                    referred to as the A-part, B-part, and so on. Each part is played twice, and the entire tune is
                    played three times; AABB, AABB, AABB. Many tunes have similar ending phrases for both A and B parts;
                    it is common for hornpipes to have the second half of each part be identical. Additionally,
                    hornpipes often have three quavers or quarternotes at the end of each part, followed by pickup notes
                    to lead back to the beginning of the A part of onto the B part. Many airs have an AABA form. While
                    airs are usually played singly, dance tunes are usually played in medleys of 2-4 tunes called sets.
                    Irish music generally is modal, using Ionian, Aeolian, Dorian, and Mixolydian modes, as well as
                    hexatonic and pentatonic versions of those scales. Some tunes do feature accidentals. Singers and
                    instrumentalists often embellish melodies through ornamentation, using grace notes, rolls, cuts,
                    crans, or slides. While uilleann pipes may use their drones and chanters to provide harmonic backup,
                    and fiddlers often use double stops in their playing, due to the importance placed on the melody in
                    Irish music, harmony is typically kept simple or absent.[8] Usually, instruments are played in
                    strict unison, always following the leading player. True counterpoint is mostly unknown to
                    traditional music, although a form of improvised “countermelody” is often used in the accompaniments
                    of bouzouki and guitar players. In contrast to many kinds of western folk music, there are no set
                    chord progressions to tunes; many accompanyists use power chords to let the melody define the
                    tonality or use partial chords in combination with ringing drone strings to emphasize the tonal
                    center. Many guitarists use DADGAD tuning because it offers flexibility in using these approaches,
                    as does the GDAD tuning for bouzouki. Like all traditional music, Irish folk music has changed
                    slowly. Most folk songs are less than 200 years old. One measure of its age is the language used.
                    Modern Irish songs are written in English and Irish. Most of the oldest songs and tunes are rural in
                    origin and come from the older Irish language tradition. Modern songs and tunes often come from
                    cities and towns, Irish songs went from the Irish language to the English language.
