                        <p class="card-text">The most common instruments used in Irish traditional dance music, whose
                            history goes back several hundred years, are the fiddle, tin whistle, flute and Uilleann
                            pipes. Instruments such as button accordion and concertina made their appearances in Irish
                            traditional music late in the 19th century. The 4-string tenor banjo, first used by Irish
                            musicians in the US in the 1920s, is now fully accepted. The guitar was used as far back as
                            the 1930s first appearing on some of the recordings of Michael Coleman and his
                            contemporaries. The bouzouki only entered the traditional Irish music world in the late
                            1960s.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Traditional dance music includes reels, hornpipes, and jigs. Jigs come in
                            various other forms for dancing – the slip jig and hop jig are commonly written in 9/8 time.
                            Later additions to the repertoire include the waltz and, in Donegal, mazurkas in the same
                            time signature, though with an accent on the 2nd beat. Donegal is also notable for its
                            “highland,” a sort of Irish version of the Scottish strathspey, but with a feel closer to a
                            reel with the occasional Scots snap. Polkas are a type of tune mostly found in the Sliabh
                            Luachra area, at the border of Cork and Kerry, in the south of Ireland. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">The revival of interest in Irish traditional culture was closely linked to
                            Nationalist calls for independence and was catalysed by the foundation of the Gaelic League
                            in 1893. This sought to encourage the rediscovery and affirmation of Irish traditional arts
                            by focusing upon the Irish language, but also established an annual competition, the Feis
                            Cheoil, in 1903 as a focus for its activities. In the US, traditional musicians remained
                            popular in Irish communities in large cities such as Chicago. </p>
