            <h3>Jigs</h3>
            <p>
                The jig is a form of lively folk dance in compound metre, as well as the accompanying dance tune. It
                developed in 16th-century England, and was quickly adopted on mainland Europe where it eventually
                became the final movement of the mature Baroque dance suite. Today it is most associated with Irish
                dance music, Scottish country dance and the Métis people in Canada. Jigs were originally in duple
                compound metre, but have been adapted to a variety of time signatures, by which they are often
                classified into groups, including light jigs, slip jigs, single jigs, double jigs, and treble jigs.
                The term jig was probably derived from the French giguer, meaning ‘to jump’ or the Italian giga. The
                use of “jig” in Irish dance derives from the Irish jigeánnai, itself borrowed from the Old English
                giga meaning “old dance”. It was known as a dance in 16th-century England, often in 12/8 time, and
                the term was used for a post-play entertainment featuring dance in early modern England, but which
                ‘probably employed a great variety of dances. During the seventeenth century the dance was adopted
                in Ireland and Scotland, where it was widely adapted, and the jig is now most often associated with
                these countries. The jig is second in popularity only to the reel in traditional Irish dance; it is
                popular but somewhat less common in Scottish country dance music.

            <h3>Reels</h3>
            <p>
                The reel is a folk dance type as well as the accompanying dance tune type. Of Scottish origin, reels
                are also an important part of the repertoire of the fiddle traditions of the British Isles and North
                America. In Scottish country dancing, the reel is one of the four traditional dances, the others
                being the jig, the strathspey and the waltz, and is also the name of a dance figure. In Irish dance,
                a reel is any dance danced to music in reel time (see below). In Irish stepdance, the reel is danced
                in soft shoes and is one of the first dances taught to students. There is also a treble reel, danced
                in hard shoes to reel music. The reel is indigenous to Scotland. The earliest reference was in a
                witchcraft trial of 1590, where the accused was reported to have "daunced this reill or short
                dance." However, the form may go back to the Middle Ages. The name is probably of Old Norse origins,
                cognate with Suio-Gothic rulla, meaning "to whirl." This became Anglo-Saxon hreol and Gaelic ruidhle
                or ruidhleadh, which is the origin of the word now. After being introduced to Ireland in the late
                eighteenth century it thrived. Later it was introduced to North America by English, Scottish, and
                Irish colonists and immigrants.

            <h3>Hornpipes</h3>
            <p>
                The hornpipe is any of several dance forms played and danced in Britain and Ireland and elsewhere
                from the 16th century until the present day. The earliest references to hornpipes are from England
                with Hugh Aston’s Hornepype of 1522 and others referring to Lancashire hornpipes in 1609 and 1613.
                It is suggested that the hornpipe as a dance began around the 16th century on English sailing
                vessels. However, the dance does not seem to have become associated with sailors until after 1740
                when the dancer Yates performed ‘a hornpipe in the character of a Jack Tar’ at Drury Lane Theatre,
                after which, in 1741 at Covent Garden we hear of ‘a hornpipe by a gentleman in the character of a
                sailor’. Movements were those familiar to sailors of that time: “looking out to sea” with the right
                hand to the forehead, then the left, lurching as in heavy weather, and giving the occasional
                rhythmic tug to their breeches both fore and aft. The hornpipe is an Irish, Scottish and English
                dance. It is done in hard shoes, which are used to help keep track of how the dancer keeps in time.
                There are two variations of the hornpipe dance: fast and slow. Usually, more experienced dancers
                will do the slow hornpipe but younger dancers will start out with the fast hornpipe and then switch
                in later years.

                    The jig (Irish: port, Scottish Gaelic: port-cruinn) is a form of lively folk dance in compound
                    metre, as well as the accompanying dance tune. It developed in 16th-century England, and was quickly
                    adopted on mainland Europe where it eventually became the final movement of the mature Baroque dance
                    suite (the French gigue; Italian and Spanish giga). Today it is most associated with Irish dance
                    music, Scottish country dance and the Métis people in Canada. Jigs were originally in duple compound
                    metre, but have been adapted to a variety of time signatures, by which they are often classified
                    into groups, including light jigs, slip jigs, single jigs, double jigs, and treble jigs. The term
                    jig was probably derived from the French giguer, meaning ‘to jump’ or the Italian giga. The use of
                    “jig” in Irish dance derives from the Irish jigeánnai, itself borrowed from the Old English giga
                    meaning “old dance”. It was known as a dance in 16th-century England, often in 12 8 time, and the
                    term was used for a post-play entertainment featuring dance in early modern England, but which
                    ‘probably employed a great variety of dances, solo (suitable for jigs), paired, round, country or
                    courtly’: in Playford’s Dancing Master (1651) ‘the dance game in ‘Kemps Jegg’ is a typical scenario
                    from a dramatic jig and it is likely that the combination of dance metre for steps and non-metrical
                    passages for pantomime indicates how a solo or ensemble jig might have been danced by stage
                    players.’ Later the dance began to be associated with music particularly in 6/8 time, and with slip
                    jigs 9/8 time. During the seventeenth century the dance was adopted in Ireland and Scotland, where
                    it was widely adapted, and the jig is now most often associated with these countries. The jig is
                    second in popularity only to the reel in traditional Irish dance; it is popular but somewhat less
                    common in Scottish country dance music. It is transcribed in compound metre, being 6/8 time. The
                    most common structure of a jig is two eight-bar parts, performing two different steps, each once on
                    the right foot, and one on the left foot. As with most other types of dance tunes in Irish music, at
                    a session or a dance it is common for two or more jigs to be strung together in a set, flowing on
                    without interruption. A light jig is the second-fastest of all the jigs. The performer's feet rarely
                    leave the ground for long, as the step is fast, typically performed at a speed around 116 at
                    feiseanna. There are several light jig steps, varying with each dance school, but one step is almost
                    standard in all light jigs. This step is known as the rising step, or the rise and grind. This is
                    the right side version of it: Put your weight on your left foot and lift your right foot off the
                    ground. Hop on your left foot once. Hop on your left foot again, bringing your right foot back
                    behind your left foot and then shift your weight onto your right foot, leaving your left foot in the
                    air. Dancers use the phrase "hop, hop back" for these three movements, and there is a slight pause
                    between the hop, and hop back. The next movement is a hop on your right foot. Then you shift your
                    weight on your feet, left-right-left-right. The phrase for this whole movement is: "hop, hop back,
                    hop back 2-3-4." To do the step on the left foot, reverse the left and right directions.

                    The reel is a folk dance type as well as the accompanying dance tune type. Of Scottish origin, reels
                    are also an important part of the repertoire of the fiddle traditions of the British Isles and North
                    America. In Scottish country dancing, the reel is one of the four traditional dances, the others
                    being the jig, the strathspey and the waltz, and is also the name of a dance figure (see below). In
                    Irish dance, a reel is any dance danced to music in reel time (see below). In Irish stepdance, the
                    reel is danced in soft shoes and is one of the first dances taught to students. There is also a
                    treble reel, danced in hard shoes to reel music. The reel is indigenous to Scotland. The earliest
                    reference was in a witchcraft trial of 1590, where the accused was reported to have “daunced this
                    reill or short dance.” However, the form may go back to the Middle Ages. The name is probably of Old
                    Norse origins, cognate with Suio-Gothic rulla, meaning “to whirl.” This became Anglo-Saxon hreol and
                    Gaelic ruidhle or ruidhleadh, which is the origin of the word now. After being introduced to Ireland
                    in the late eighteenth century it thrived. Later it was introduced to North America by English,
                    Scottish, and Irish colonists and immigrants. In the United States, reels remain central in the
                    traditions Anglo & African American Old-time music and square dancing, as well as Cajun and Zydeco.
                    In Canada, they are important parts of Cape Breton, Acadian, Quebecois, and Métis repertoires. Reel
                    music is notated in simple metre, either as 2/2 or 4/4. For example, the same reel Rakish Paddy is
                    notated in a 2/2 time signature in O’Neill’s Music of Ireland, New & Revisited, but in 4/4 time in
                    English, Welsh, Scottish & Irish Fiddle Tunes, with no change to the note lengths. All reels have
                    the same structure, consisting largely of quaver (eighth note) movement with an accent on the first
                    and third beats of the bar. A reel is distinguished from a hornpipe in two ways. Firstly they are
                    played with even beats, without an implied dotted rhythm. Secondly they are played twice as fast,
                    implied by the 2/2 time signature. Like most dance music originating in the British Isles, reels are
                    usually composed in binary form, meaning they have two parts (A and B); in most reels each part is
                    repeated (AABB), but in others it is not (ABAB). Each part (A and B) typically has eight bars, which
                    in turn are divisible into four-bar and two-bar phrases. (An exception is the "auld reel" of
                    Shetland which tends to irregular structure and may have been influenced by the Norwegian halling.)
                    The example of Jimmy Shand performing Mairi's Wedding follows the pattern ABABB, giving a pattern of
                    40 bars. The group of 32 bars (four times eight) is itself repeated three or four times before a
                    second reel is introduced. The grouping of two or more tunes in medleys or "sets" is typical in
                    Celtic dance music.[citation needed] Today many Irish reels are supplemented with new compositions
                    and by tunes from other traditions which are easily adapted as reels. It is the most popular
                    tune-type within the Irish dance music tradition.

                    The hornpipe is any of several dance forms played and danced in Britain and Ireland and elsewhere
                    from the 16th century until the present day. The earliest references to hornpipes are from England
                    with Hugh Aston’s Hornepype of 1522 and others referring to Lancashire hornpipes in 1609 and 1613.
                    It is suggested that the hornpipe as a dance began around the 16th century on English sailing
                    vessels. However, the dance does not seem to have become associated with sailors until after 1740
                    when the dancer Yates performed ‘a hornpipe in the character of a Jack Tar’ at Drury Lane Theatre,
                    after which, in 1741 at Covent Garden we hear of ‘a hornpipe by a gentleman in the character of a
                    sailor.’. Movements were those familiar to sailors of that time: “looking out to sea” with the right
                    hand to the forehead, then the left, lurching as in heavy weather, and giving the occasional
                    rhythmic tug to their breeches both fore and aft. The hornpipe is an Irish, Scottish and English
                    dance. It is done in hard shoes, which are used to help keep track of how the dancer keeps in time.
                    There are two variations of the hornpipe dance: fast and slow. Usually, more experienced dancers
                    will do the slow hornpipe but younger dancers will start out with the fast hornpipe and then switch
                    in later years. There is a change of tempo in the music but not the dancing between these two
                    speeds. The only difference in the dancing between the fast and slow steps are the dances that the
                    competitor does and the rhythm/sound of how they move their legs. The rhythm for both fast and slow
                    hornpipes is very even and should be executed that way by the dancer. The most common use of the
                    term nowadays refers to a class of tunes in 4/4 time. The dance is done in hard shoes. Perhaps the
                    best known example is the “Sailors’ Hornpipe”. There are two basic types of common-time hornpipe,
                    ones like the “Sailors’ Hornpipe”, moving in even notes, sometimes notated in 2 2, moving a little
                    slower than a reel, and ones like “The Harvest Home”, moving in dotted notes. Some 19th-century
                    examples mix the dotted and even styles. These led the form to being called the ‘Newcastle Style’
                    [3] The form dates back to the mid-18th century or earlier but became much more popular in the early
                    19th century. Many fine hornpipes were written in this period, often with well-known composers. In
                    Ireland, examples include “The Groves Hornpipe” and “The Boys of Bluehill”. In England, a noted
                    composer of hornpipes on Tyneside was the influential fiddler-publican James Hill (c.1811-1853). The
                    form also became very popular in the United States – “President Garfield’s Hornpipe” being a fine
                    example.
